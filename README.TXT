This is a collection of some audio effects for DotNet Core SDK.

This project is essentially the same project I made using C++ for Windows and Unix based systems.
I made this project mainly focused on testing the features and functionalities of C# and DotNet Core SDK.

I'm probably not going to update this project, at least not very often. If you wish to see the latest updates on Audio FX Collection, 
check the C++ repository for Windows and/or Unix.
